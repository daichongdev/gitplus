# gitplus

A Git enhancement tool that provides convenient features for managing Git-tracked files.
This plugin adds context menu actions to help you:
- Remove files from Git cache while keeping them in your working directory (git rm --cached)
- Add files or directories to .gitignore with a single click

        All operations can be performed directly from the project view context menu,
        making Git file management more efficient and user-friendly.
